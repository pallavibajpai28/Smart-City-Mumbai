            <h2>1.Secret Bunker</h2>
            <p>About secret Bunker: From historical anecdotes, tokens of colonial craftsmanship, to virtual reality booths that offer cannon-firing experience — Raj Bhavan’s Bunker Museum is almost like travelling back in time to the 19th century.
                On rather mildly sunny afternoon, the waves of a greyish-blue Arabian Sea come crashing against the rocks creating a net of pure white foam; the coconut trees around dance to the tunes of the wind blowing across the perfectly-trimmed lawns, and far across the shore, the entire skyline of Mumbai seems like a distant world altogether from Raj Bhavan.
                 Little did one know that the official residence of the Governor of Maharashtra houses a real chamber of secrets that remained unearthed (quite literally) for years.
                 Being in the premises of Mumbai’s Raj Bhavan complex is an experience in itself:
                  Spread across 50 acres of land, surrounded by the sea on three sides, a mile-long stretch of thick forests, and, of course, several remnants of a bygone era. 
                  To enhance this experience further, the gates to an underground bunker museum — spread over an area of 15,000 square feet — will be opened for the general public. 
                  From historical anecdotes, tokens of colonial craftsmanship, to virtual reality booths that offer a cannon-firing experience — Raj Bhavan’s Bunker Museum (as it is being called now) is almost like travelling back in time to the 19th century.
                  Opening time: 6 am - 8.30 am
                 6 am - 8.30 am, all days (except Mondays and bank holidays)
