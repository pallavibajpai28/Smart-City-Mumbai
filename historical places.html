            <h2>2.Kanheri caves</h2>
            <p>The word Kanheri was taken from the Sanskrit word Krishnagiri or Kanhagiri, which translates to black mountain (Krishna means black and giri means mountain).

                Kanheri Caves or Kanheri Gufas are a collection of 109 rock-cut monuments, the earliest ones dating back to the 1st century BC. The history of these caves is also associated with the spread of Buddhism in the region. The gufas house many sculptures, paintings and inscriptions, suggesting that the cave complex was used by Buddhist monks for living, worshipping, studying scriptures and meditating. Hence, they were known as Buddhist Viharas as well.
                
                The congregation halls in the caves feature large stupas which indicate that Kanheri Caves were considered important Buddhist shrines in ancient times. The caves reportedly were among the most important places where Buddhists settled during the 3rd century. According to historians and archaeologists, these caves were also used as rain shelters by monks Timings

    <h2>6.Banganga Tank</h2>
    <p>The Banganga Tank is a temple tank which is part of the Hindu Walkeshwar Temple complex in the Malabar Hill area of the city of Mumbai, India . The tank was built in AD 1127 by Lakshman Prabhu, a minister in the court of Silhara kings of Thane.
         It was rebuilt in 1715, funded by a donation from Rama Kamath.
         Tucked away on the tip of Mumbai's exclusive Malabar Hill, at the northern end of Back Bay, Banganga Tank is a sacred oasis where it feels like time has stood still for centuries. 
         The tank is a contrasting microcosm of the fast-paced city, and one which many locals aren't even familiar with.
        how to visit banganga Tank
        A flight of stairs will take you from the main road to the temple and tank complex. Sadly, the tank and its ghats may not always be spic and span. Explore the hidden gem of Mumbai at Banganga Tank in Walkeshwar. 
        Discover the ancient legend, temples, and historical significance of this serene oasis tucked away in the bustling city.
        Banganga in Santana (Hindu) History

        Banganga Tank and Walkeshwar Temple, c. 1855
        According to local legend, the temple sprang forth when Rama, the exiled hero of the epic Ramayana, stopped at the spot in search of his kidnapped wife, Sita.
        
        As the legend goes, overcome with fatigue and thirst, Rama asked his brother Lakshmana to bring him some water. Lakshmana instantly shot an arrow into the ground, and water gushed forth from the ground, creating a tributary of the Ganges, which flows over a thousand miles away – hence its name, Banganga, ie the Ganga created by a baan (arrow).
        
        The Banganga also houses the Shri Kashi Math and Shri Kaivalya/Kavale Math of the Goud Saraswat Brahmins on its banks, including samadhis of the maths’ past heads.
        
        The area also has a Hindu cremation groundwhich after 2003 received a makeover to house a gas crematorium.
        
        The area still has an old Hindu cemetery consisting of samadhi shrines of various advaitin gurus, such as Siddharameshwar Maharaj (1888–1936) and his disciple, Ranjit Maharaj (1913–2000),Nisaragdatta Maharaj(1897-1981), Bhainath Maharaj</p>

<h2> 7.Gilbert Hill</h2>
            <p>Gilbert hill is possibly the oldest standing piece of nature’s creation India has seen. This almost 200 feet tall monolith structure is dated 66 million years old – primarily made up of basalt rock. Studies show it was formed during the Mesozoic era – owing to the volcanic eruptions from the Earth – with the only other similar formation on Earth being present in the USA, called the Devil’s Tower. The name, Gilbert Hill, coined by the British has since stuck, but this place isn’t attracting enough tourists. So we decided to check it out.

                We revisited this hill and found a discarded shoddy hill unlike what its glorious history proclaims. It’s really easy to get there, just get an auto towards Bhavans college and you can walk from there. Though it’s surrounded by the slums that have cropped up alongside it, as well as the mirage of white sky rocketing building, the hill stands tall and beckoning.
                
                What To Do
                Start the climb from the staircase that’s been carved out of the rocks at the foothills of Gilbert. After about five minutes, we were at the top. 
                There’s an old Hindu temple here, that’s been around for decades, Gaodevi Durgamata – which also sees a lot of crowd during the festival of Hanuman Jayanti.
                
                We walked around the temple on the grass paths, and loved every bit of it. It has a beautiful, uncontested view of the city from all directions.
                 You can see as far as the city is from the shiny Arabian sea to the high rises of modern Lokhandwala to the metro line. Turn north-east and be greeted by the green forest pastures of Aarey Milk colony. It gives us one of the best vantage points to the suburban areas of Mumbai, even giving us a glimpse all the way to Worli – just squint and you’ll see. The views of beaches and the sea, however, is what really had a calming effect on us. 
                Catch one of the best sunsets you can from here – coloured skies like a painted canvas.</p>
