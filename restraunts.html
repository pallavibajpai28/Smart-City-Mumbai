        <h2> 5.Masque, Mahalaxm</h2>
        <p>The Masque team travels far and wide, from the forests of Kashmir to the shores of Goa, to bring back hyperlocal ingredients from across the country to their restaurant in Mahalaxmi, where these ingredients undergo seemingly magical transformations before they arrive at your table. Born and brought up in Mumbai, chef Varun Totlani started off at Masque as commis chef and rose the ranks to become head chef in 2022. Along with founder and entrepreneur Aditi Dugar, the restaurant’s 10-course seasonal chef’s tasting menus marry tradition and innovation, transforming homegrown produce into fine-dining dishes. So, a Lonavala inspired chocolate fudge gets topped with kachampuli ice cream, Coorg’s pandi curry is made with jackfruit sausage, and the winter favourite Gujarati snack ponkh bhel is zhuzhed up with Goan seaweed.

    <h2>6.O Pedro, BKC</h2>
        <p>At O Pedro, the drinks and food aim to transport you from the busy, commercial BKC to the sunny, tropical life in Goa. 
            The energetic bar mixes up signature concoctions like the Pedro’s G&T, the Kokum Stings featuring kokum infused rum and the Vasco Sour with pisco, triple sec and Goan toddy. Bright colours, quirky sayings on the walls and cheery servers are as much a part of the O Pedro experience as the lipsmacking food, from the coconut-ey crab kismoor and signature prawn balchao to the fluffy poees with choriz butter and creamy, crunchy mushroom ceviche. The flakey pastel de nata (Portuguese egg custard tarts) and Aunty Li’s serradura hark back to Goa’s rich Portuguese influences and are not to be missed.

    <h2>7.Americano, Kala Ghoda

    </h2>
        <p>Since its hotly anticipated debut in March 2019, Americano has been a destination for creative cuisine and expertly crafted cocktails.
             Located in the arts precinct of Kala Ghoda, Mumbai, the restaurant features 20-ft ceilings and fluted glass windows, with elegant and understated décor. Head chef Alex Sanchez has trained under the likes of Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park, New York, and was also behind the launch of The Table and Magazine Street Kitchen. Americano, which Sanchez launched with his partner Mallyeka Watsa, is known for its pizzas topped with braised mushrooms, smoky bacon and fennel sausage, corn ribs, and creamy handmade pastas. The Americano tiramisu has a separate fanbase. Spongy and chilled, with a hidden layer of tempered chocolate, the tiramisu is scooped out and served fresh right at the table.

<h2> 8.The Table, Colaba</h2>
        <p>In a sea of Mumbai restaurants serving globally-inspired menus, The Table stands out for its flavour, but also for its consistent farm-to-table approach for over a decade.
             A lot of the restaurant’s produce comes from The Table Farm a ferry ride away in Alibaug, while the fish and meat is sourced fresh in the city. The menu, which largely features shareable plates, takes inspiration from different corners of the world, from Thailand and Japan to France and the Americas. Dig into sophisticated plates—like their signature ginger glazed boneless chicken wings, the aptly named Sobo Salad with Hass avocado and greens and succulent lamb ragout with pappardelle pasta—in an easy, casual fine-dining setting, all at a stellar location right behind the iconic Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Colaba, Mumbai.
