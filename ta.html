            <p>Marine Drive is a 3 kilometre-long Promenade along the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road in Mumbai, India. The road and promenade were constructed by Pallonji Mistry. It is a banana-shaped, six-lane concrete road along the coast of a natural bay. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Girgaon Chowpatty and the adjacent road along links Nariman Point at southern tip to Babulnath and Malabar Hill at northern tip. Marine Drive is situated on reclaimed land facing west-south-west.

            <h2>2.GateWay of India</h2>
            <p>The Gateway of India is an arch-monument completed in 1924 on the waterfront of Mumbai (Bombay), India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of George V for his coronation as the Emperor of India in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain. He was the first British monarch to visit India.
                The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, inspired by elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.</p>

        <h2>5.Kwan Kung Temple
        </h2>
        <p>Inconspicuously hidden among the myriad buildings in Mazagaon Dockyard, Kwan Kung Temple is the only Chinese temple in Mumbai. 
            Located a half-hour drive away from our hotel, the building comprises an auspicious red door and Chinese lettering on a board above the door. If the religious history of our largest neighbours has been a source of fascination for you,
             then this item on our list of offbeat places in Mumbai is the right destination!
             WHEN THE KWAN KUNG TEMPLE was built in Mumbai in 1919, it was an important part of the city’s then-sizable Chinese community. Mumbai’s Chinatown, in the area now known as Mazagaon, was full of shops, restaurants, and places of worship. However, the Sino-Indian war in 1962 forced many Chinese residents to leave the city, and today the neighborhood only hints of its past.

             The Kwan Kung temple, located in a two-story house on a tiny lane in Mazagaon, is one of the remaining traces of the vibrant Chinese community that used to call Mumbai home. Today, it is the only Chinese temple in the city. 
             
             Walking toward the wooden stairs that lead to the top of the temple, there is a mural of three deities—the Chinese gods of blessing, longevity, and prosperity—dressed in yellow, purple, and green robes. The temple itself is one large room, its focal point a red altar with gold carvings. Above the altar is a painting of the Chinese god of justice, protection, and courage, and the temple’s namesake, Kwan Kung.

Inside there is also a statue of the mighty warrior god, Kwan Tai Kwon. On a small table in front are the offerings—paper money, gold and silver paper, incense, envelopes filled with either rice or money. Worshipers at the site will also find Kau cim, or fortune sticks, small wooden sticks that are part of a fortune-telling practice dating back to the third century.

Albert Tham, along with his mother, acts as a caretaker for the temple and lives on the first floor of the building. “I have lived here all my life. I’m Chinese but Mumbai is my home, I can’t leave it,” Albert Tham told the website The Better India. 
 The Tham family keeps the keys to the temple and organizes the space for events such as Chinese New Year and Moon Festival, which can bring up to 500 visitors to the temple.</p>

    <h2>6.David Sassoon Library and Reading Room</h2>
    <p>In 2006, the library was mentioned in the list of 47 global classical libraries. The library is a captivating place for all the book-lovers. You must visit the heritage sight in South Mumbai for an enriching experience. The interior decorations are equally classy and beautiful. Exploring the 40,000+ books in the library is enticing. So, as you leave your hourly couple friendly hotel in Andheri, remember to drop by the library.
        In 1847, European employees working in the Government Mint and the Dockyard in Mumbai started the Mechanics' Institution to provide technical education to adults and to hold lectures. Initially, they operated from leased premises until they relocated to their own facility, which was made possible by the support of David Sassoon. Later, the establishment was named the David Sassoon Library and Reading Room.[2]

        The structure, built in the architectural style of Victorian Neogothic during the period from 1867 to 1870, maintains its original colonial allure. It features pointed arches, columns adorned with animal motifs, and intricately designed trusses and ceilings made of Burma teak wood. Now a Grade I heritage structure, 
        the library's building is among the earliest constructions in the vicinity following the removal of the fort walls in the 1860s
